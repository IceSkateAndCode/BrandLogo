# BrandLogo

 ## Description
 This is a tester for creating custom logos in ReactNative Expo.  It is also where I am starting to create a magic system for the demo-type RPG I will make later on in the semester.  That is, it will be from the intro through the first dungeon.

 ## Features
 - Tab navigation to go between screens
 - A custom logo for loding screens

 ## How to Use
 Simply open the app and browse the tabs.  You can read the info on each of them

 ## Notes to Self
 - *This is how to italicize text* * *
 - **This is how to bold text** ** **
 - ***This is how to bold and italicize text*** *** ***
 - <u>This is how to underline text</u>  (doesn't seem to be working tho)    < u > < /u >
